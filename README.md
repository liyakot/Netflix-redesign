### Description
___
Updated Netflix is a test updated version of the well-known site. I took the basic design from <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/93925195/NETFLIX-REDESIGN-UXUI-Movies-TV-Series">here</a>, but changed it a bit. This is a desktop version of the site, designed for devices with a width of 992px or more

The project was created using React and SCSS.

### How it works
___
There are three screens in the game:
1. Start game
2. Choose a time
3. Game board

Changing screens is done by adding or remove the *up* class to the *screen*:
`.screen.up {
    margin-top: -100vh;
}`

**The game board looks like this:**

**How to make a circle appear of random size in random places on the board:**

At the end of the game, **the result** is displayed - **the number of hits on circle**, and you can start the game again

I've learned myself web development without any courses or training, so if you have any comments, I will be happy to chat with you on social networks (see  my <a href="https://github.com/liyakot">profile</a> :fire:)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
